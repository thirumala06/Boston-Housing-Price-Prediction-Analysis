# Boston-Housing-Price-Prediction-Analysis
 This problem involves the “Boston” data set, which we saw in the lab for this chapter. We will now try to predict per capita crime rate using the other variables in this data set. In other words, per capita crime rate is the response, and the other variables are the predictors.
a.	For each predictor, fit a simple linear regression model to predict the response. Describe your results. In which of the models is there a statistically significant association between the predictor and the response ? Create some plots to back up your assertions.
b.	Fit a multiple regression model to predict the response using all of the predictors. Describe your results. For which predictors can we reject the null hypothesis H0:βj=0 ?
# Description
This problem involves analyzing the Boston housing dataset to predict the per capita crime rate using socio-economic and housing-related variables. In this study, crime rate is treated as the response variable, while all other attributes are used as predictors. Simple and multiple linear regression models are applied to identify significant factors influencing crime levels.
