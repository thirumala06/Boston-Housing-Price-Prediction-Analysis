# Boston-Housing-Price-Prediction-Analysis
I have used the Boston data to predict the crime rate using other factors. When we looked at each factor one by one, most of them were clearly related to crime rate. The graphs also showed visible increasing or decreasing trends. However, when we used all factors together in one model, only some variables were truly important. This happens because many factors are related to each other. Overall, crime rate depends on several area characteristics, but only a few have a strong independent effect.
